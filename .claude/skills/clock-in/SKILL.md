description: Start a Metsävahti work session — read PROGRESS.md and feature_list.json, run ./init.sh, report the baseline and activate exactly one feature (WIP=1). Use when the user says "clock in", "start a session", "what should I work on next", or before beginning feature work.

Run the clock-in routine from AGENTS.md → Clock-in. Requested feature: `$ARGUMENTS` (empty = pick automatically).

1. `pwd` — confirm the repository root (it contains `AGENTS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `feature_list.json`).
2. Read `PROGRESS.md`: Current Verified State and Next Steps. Read `feature_list.json` (or `pnpm harness:feature list`).
3. `git log --oneline -5` and `git status --short`. If `src/` is dirty while the state files are not, stop and report: a previous session ended without clock-out; do not build on top of it without the user's decision.
4. `./init.sh` (use `FAST=1 ./init.sh` only if the user asked for a quick start, or when `HARNESS_LOOP=1` is set — the driver already ran it). If it fails, the baseline is red: fixing that is the session's first job. Report the failure and stop the routine.
5. Choose the feature: the requested id if given, otherwise `pnpm harness:feature next --include-manual` (lowest priority, `not_started`, every `depends_on` passing). If a feature is already `in_progress`, continue it instead — never activate a second one.
6. `pnpm harness:feature show <id>`: quote its `user_visible_behavior`, `verification`, `spec` and `design` fields. Read the linked spec section and open the linked design artboard(s) before writing code. Confirm with the user that this is the feature to work on (skip the confirmation when `HARNESS_LOOP=1`).
7. `pnpm harness:feature activate <id>` — it enforces WIP=1 and the dependency rule, bumps `last_updated` and re-validates the file. Never edit the status by hand.

Finish with a short summary: baseline result, active feature, the layers it needs, and any blocker from `PROGRESS.md`.
